Here's a list of some common algorithms that can be applied to arrays:

Searching Algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search (for sorted arrays)
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Array Manipulation Algorithms:

Reversing an array
Rotating an array
Shuffling an array
Removing duplicates from an array
Finding the intersection, union, or difference of two arrays
Subset Generation Algorithms:

Generating all subsets of an array
Generating all permutations of an array
Sum and Product Related Algorithms:

Finding the sum of elements in an array
Finding the product of elements in an array
Finding the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm)
Searching for Specific Patterns:

Finding peaks and valleys in an array
Finding local minima or maxima
Finding the majority element (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
Other Algorithms:

Finding the kth largest/smallest element in an array (using techniques like quickselect or binary search)
Sliding window algorithms (e.g., finding the maximum sum subarray of fixed size)
Two-pointer technique (e.g., finding pairs with a given sum)
These are just some examples, and there are many more algorithms and techniques that can be applied to arrays depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve.
